        <p>The Hillcrest Library Website provides many features and works hand in hand with the Hillcrest National STEM
            Boys'
            School Library. It's use is to reduce congestion in the physical library. Seeing that Hillcrest has developed
            in
            terms of technology it offers pupils a platform to view books at the library on screen and even offers them
            the
            opportunity to download softcopy books and share their own books on the website.
        </p>
        <p>The main intention of this website is to help in the battle of the covid-19 pandemic by controlling the
            number of
            pupils while observing social distancing as pupils visit the library.it also regulates the distribution of
            books
            making it easier to keep tabs on borrowed books and quantity of books available at the library.</p>
